# Holiday Reservation System

This project is completed in 5 weeks for IS2103 Enterprise Systems Server-side Design and Development.

It uses Jarkata EE and GlassFish for its server.

This project was intended to implement the use cases of a typical holiday reservation system into a multi-tier project.
The presentation tier is CLI while logic tier is using EJB technology and data tier comes from GlassFish database.

It challenged me to fully encapsulate and abstract out code that is fully functional and scalable. I learned the importance of multi-tier architecture that emphasises on component-based development. Through this project, I have gained appreciation of EJB technology and Web Services that uses RESTful and SOAP services.
